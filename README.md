# BAP SDK

## A comprehensive NodeJS + React Native SDK, empowering developers to efficiently create Beckn-enabled consumer-facing applications (BAPs) using a streamlined boilerplate codebase. The SDK takes care of Beckn's backend code, allowing developers to prioritize UI/UX enhancements and simplify the overall development process.

## Application: The SDK not only manages the backend code but also offers a pre-designed UI template. This eliminates the need for users to start their applications from scratch. They can make modifications to the provided UI, while the SDK handles the backend intricacies. This approach lets developers focus sharply on refining UI and UX, thus streamlining the development process.
